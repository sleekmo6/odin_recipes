    <h1><strong>West African Grilled Beef(Suya)</strong></h1>
    <p>This is my take on Suya, grilled beef skewers from West Africa. Sirloin steak is marinated in a quick and easy marinade that is extremely delicious and perfect for cooking on the grill.</p>
    <p>This incredibly flavorful, West African-style skewer started out as a geographically appropriate main course to pair with a batch of Jollof rice, but quickly turned into my new favorite marinade for beef.</p>
